    </li>
    <li>Go into the (.xlsm) file you created earlier, in any empty cell type "=SetOpenAIKey(*YOUR_API_KEY*)" with the secret key you just copied.</li>
    <li>To test if this was assigned correctly, in a new empty cell, type "=GetOpenAIKey()". The resulting value should be the key you saved.</li>
    <li>In the case this doesn't work, you will need to include the key in all of your queries as the second parameter. For example: "=ChatCompletion('What President is on the $1 bill?', *YOUR_API_KEY*)".</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Each query made with the function <code>=ChatCompletion()</code> uses OpenAI tokens, which are chargeable at the rates set by OpenAI for GPT-3.5 Turbo - 4k context. For more information, please read <a href="https://openai.com/pricing" target="_blank">https://openai.com/pricing</a>. As such, it is recommended to take actions like disabling auto-function renewal, pasting function output as text once completed, and limiting excessive function calls.</li>
    <li>Certain non-standard characters may not be parsed correctly as JSON when running a query. It is recommended that all new line and tab characters (CHAR(10) and CHAR(9)) are converted to their JSON safe equivalents ('\n', '\t') beforehand.</li>
  </ul>
